                Yes, it's just a game, but we take player conduct
                on our servers very seriously.
                We pride outselve on a fun, relaxed environment to play in and our rules are rigorously enforced with that in mind.

                <li>Friendly Fire is always ON</li>
                <li>All activity is logged</li>
                <li>Abusive language, swearing, racist names, and
                    behaviour are not tolerated</li>
                <li>Hacks, cheats, and map exploits are all perma-bans</li>
                <li>Deliverate and retaliatory TA/TKing will result in a time ban</li>

                <span class="yellow">**</span> Pistol rolling is quick-switching
                your pistol between scoped weapon shots to avoid the reload animation.
                We consider this a game exploit contrary to the spitiy of fair play.
                No, we don't care that all the 'pros' do it :&#41;
